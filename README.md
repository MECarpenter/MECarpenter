### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Maria Carpenter, a passionate student at Arizona State University pursuing a degree in Graphic Information Technology. As a mother of two wonderful boys, I'm constantly juggling responsibilities, including my part-time job at Starbucks.

ðŸŽ“ While I may not have extensive work experience, I'm fueled by an insatiable drive for learning and a deep passion for technology and design. I'm dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge within the field of graphic information technology.

ðŸ’¼ Currently in my journey towards graduation, I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired during my studies to real-world projects. With just a couple of years left until graduation, I'm determined to break into the industry and make a meaningful impact.

ðŸŒŸ Let's connect and embark on this exciting journey together! I'm always open to collaboration and learning new things. Reach out to me if you'd like to chat about graphic design, technology, or any other projects.
